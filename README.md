xmonad configuration
====================

This is another xmonad configuration file on GitHub. The file was forked from xmonad-config project of brafales at github. I have made some changes to the config, so that it better supports my profile of daily use.

Feel free to also change, fork or do whatever you like with this piece of incitement.

Have a look at the original repo or the corresponding web page [explaining post at ThinkInGeek](http://thinkingeek.com/2011/11/21/simple-guide-configure-xmonad-dzen2-conky/); if you are new to xmonad, I suggest visting the projects page on the web ([xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)), too.
